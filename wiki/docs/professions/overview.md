<h1 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Professions</strong></h1>
<p>Unique sets of different objectives you can train by completing quests, performing tasks, and helping NPCs! Training a profession can reward you with knowledge of that specific profession&apos;s items, which you then gain the ability of crafting and using.</p>
<p>There are currently 7 Professions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Farming</li>
    <li>Foraging</li>
    <li>Mining</li>
    <li>Slayer</li>
    <li>Enchanting</li>
    <li>Cooking</li>
    <li>Spellforging</li>
</ul>
<p>Each profession currently maxes out at Level 10. You can level up your Professions by completing quests, doing objectives, and crafting items related to the profession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leveling up a profession gives you access to knowledge of items within that profession, which can be crafted within each profession&apos;s shop. Each shop can be access from the main menu and also profession vendors inside the Town Hall.</p>
