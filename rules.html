<h3><strong>1. <u>No Hacking or using Hacked Clients</u></strong></h3>
<p>Using any Client, Mod, Third Party Software, or anything else which gives you an advantage over other players is not allowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is allowed? It's hard to cover everything which is allowed, but if you have further questions about specifics, contact me on Discord&nbsp;Monzter#4951!</p>
<p><strong>Allowed Mods / Client<br /></strong>Optifine Mod<br />Mini-Map Mod<br />Replay Mod<br />Laby Mod<br />Badlion Client<br />Many other mods / clients are allowed, but these were the main ones I could think of.</p>
<h3><strong>2. <u>Macros</u></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;You're permitted to use Macros to automate very specific tasks which currently only include Chat Commands. Using a Macro for anything else is not allowed.</p>
<h3><strong>3. <u>Auto-Clicker</u></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;Currently Auto-Clickers are allowed while interactive with NPCs, such as buying items from them, but also against Mobs. I personally get tired of clicking 100 times when just killing a Mob, and having an auto-clicker do that I feel is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>I expect this rule to change in the future, but as of now I feel this is just for player's convenience. If you're caught using an Auto-Clicker while AFK or using it to automate any task, you will be punished.</p>
<h3><strong>4. <u>Bugs, Glitches, &amp; Exploits</u></strong></h3>
<p>Any unintended features, mechanics, or gameplay which give players an advantage over others. These are not to be spread or used and should be sent directly to Staff or Monzter#4951.</p>
<p>If you want clarification if something is a Bug, Glitch, or Exploit you can contact Staff.</p>
<h3><strong>5. <u>Toxic Environment</u></strong></h3>
<p>Stay away from bringing others down in chat. Insulting players or just being negative in general should be kept out of chat. You specifically should not curse and other players, insinuate self harm, wish death upon, or be overly toxic towards others.</p>
<h3><strong>6. <u>Racism</u></strong></h3>
<p>Racism is completely prohibited against any race. This shouldn't need to be said and falls under the toxic environment rule, but I'd like to keep it as clear as possible.</p>
<h3><strong>7. <u>Spam</u></strong></h3>
<p>Do not spam the same or very similar message in chat. If you attempt to bypass the anti-spam filter or any chat filter, you'll be punished as well.</p>
<h3><strong>8. <u>Advertising</u></strong></h3>
<p>Do not advertise anything. Do not advertise your Minecraft Server, Discord Server, TeamSpeak Server, YouTube Channel, Twitch Channel, or anything else. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>9. <u>Staff Impersonation</u></strong></h3>
<p>Claiming you are Staff in chat, or changing your Minecraft name to be very similar to a Staff Member will result in being punished.</p>
<h3><strong>10. <u>Account Sharing &amp; VPNs</u></strong></h3>
<p>Sharing your account with another person is allowed, and so is having multiple accounts. Keep in mind though, that all accounts are tracked along with their IP Address. If your account is used on a VPN for example your account will then be linked with all other accounts which have been on that IP.</p>
<p>Punishments maybe given to all accounts attached to the same IP. This is a risk you run of sharing your account, or using a VPN.</p>
<h3><strong>11. <u>AFK</u></strong></h3>
<p>AFK Pools or methods to stay online are allowed. You are not allowed to earn any XP, Currency, or progress while AFK. If you find a method, let me know on Discord Monzter#4951 and I'll fix it.</p>		</div>
